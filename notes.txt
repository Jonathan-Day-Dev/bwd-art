Brownwood Art Association has a regular People Painters group that meets most Wednesdays. 
Artists of all skill levels working in any medium are welcome. The group works from either live 
models or a photograph on a monitor. For more information,  contact Brenda Shaw at 325-642-0417. 
This portrait was done in the People Painter group by Judy Kirksey.
