              BAA wants to promote artistic expression in all its forms, and has
              extended its media horizon to include fiber and textile arts.
              Anyone interested in fiber and textile arts in invited to join.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-tight">
              The new group includes traditional fiber arts such as embroidery,
              weaving, and macram√©, but artistic expression is open to a wide
              range of media. Fiber and textiles are among the oldest artistic
              expressions known. This new group brings these ancient and
              traditional arts into a contemporary environment where they can
              inspire and grow in relation to our modern contemporary world.

              There are many textile artists in our community, and our goal is
              to bring them together and provide a forum that inspires and
              encourages others to try their artistic hand at textiles.
