    description: "I have been an assemblage artist that works with 3D art since 2007. I started designing artistic pocket watches as a form of grief therapy. I now work with a variety of mediums.  Each of my designs are one of a kind. Many hours go into each piece from finding the perfect antique items to complete an idea in my head to hours of design work. I prefer to create with outdated, broken items to give them new purpose. Some pieces of work come easily, others may take years to complete. My work is designed to be passed down through generations.",
