        "Have you ever met a time traveler? Introduce yourself to Boyd Harris,
        and maybe he’ll share a story from his adventures, as you take in his
        retrospective exhibit, 50 years in the making. Harris describes himself
        as “a geologist by training and an artist by heart.” “History and
        ancient cultures have always fascinated me. I grew up during my
        formative years in New Mexico, a state known for its natural beauty and
        its many artists. This tradition goes back thousands of years to the
        ceramics, rock art, and other cultural materials the indigenous Native
        Americans left us, and make to this day.” As he immersed himself in the
        arts culture as a young man, he also observed the hardship artists had
        in earning income, and resolved to follow a career path in geology that
        offered some financial security. He spent years working in the oil
        fields of the Permian Basin, which he sardonically calls “the gold
        camp,” but stayed active as an artist and art instructor, teaching
        ceramics and sculpture at Midland College. The overlap between his
        geology career and the arts is evident in many of his works which
        include images and abstractions of geological features, folds and faults
        of the earth’s crust, and scenes from the age of the dinosaurs. There
        will also be more traditional paintings of landscapes and seascapes, as
        well as abstracts, monoprints, sgraffito, retablos, and a variety of
        ceramics, including raku, pit fire ceramics, and stone ware. Time
        travel, and the connections between ancient past, present, and far
        future, remain underlying themes of Boyd Harris art. He poses the
        question: “Is the modern artist a Shaman teaching people a new way to
        look at the world around themselves? I ask the patron to make what they
        will of my art in their own mind and hopefully they will learn and enjoy
        it. Maybe it will show them a new way to look at things."-{" "}
